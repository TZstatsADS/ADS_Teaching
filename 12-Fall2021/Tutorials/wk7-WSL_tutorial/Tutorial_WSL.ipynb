    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "From Wikipedia - **Supervised learning** is the machine learning task of learning a function that maps an input to an output based on example input-output pairs (i.e. training set). \n",
    "\n",
    "Most successful techniques, such as deep learning, require ground-truth labels to be given for a big training data\n",
    "set; in many tasks, however, it can be difficult to attain strong supervision information due to the high cost of the data-labeling process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, it is desirable for machine-learning techniques to be able to work with weak supervision. In general, we refer these tasks as weakly supervised learning (WSL)."

There may exist ‘spammers’ who assign almost random labels to the tasks (e.g. robots pretendto be a human forthe monetary payment), or ‘adversaries’ who give incorrect answers deliberately."

Each input is projected into an embedding by a linear layer and the two are concatenated, then transformed with a hidden linear layer. Finally, $y$ is added to the output by an identity-skip connection and clipped to $[0, 1]$ to remain in the valid label space. For the training, they consider to minimize the $L_1$ loss.\n",
