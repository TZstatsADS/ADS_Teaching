# Project 2: Shiny App Development

The App directory contains the app files for the Shiny App (ui.R, server.R and global.R).
 - ui.R and server.R are two key components for the Shiny App
       ui.R controls the UI of the Shiny App.
       server.R implemented plots and interactive functions
 - global.R is used to preprocess the data and define functions that used in server.R
       some of the processed data is stored in outcome folder
 - output folder contains the data used for deployment and it will be reproduced once global.R runs.
