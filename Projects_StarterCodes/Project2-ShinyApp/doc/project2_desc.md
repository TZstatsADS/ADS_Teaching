### GR5243/GU4243 Fall 2023 Applied Data Science
### Project 2 Shiny App Development
### --- App Development using OpenFEMA data

### Challenge

Since 1979, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has been the Federal Government’s lead agency in responding to and recovering from many of the Nation’s greatest moments of crisis. For this project, we invite you to develop an *Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization* shiny app using one of [**the OpenFEMA Data Sets**](https://www.fema.gov/about/openfema/data-sets) of your choice. Working in teams, you will create the app for exploring and visualizing the data. The design of the visualization tool should be well motivated by the subject area of your choice.

For presentation, the team should present their **shiny app** as a *product demo*, supported by interesting findings that are visualized by this app. Teams can also share technical challenges and their creative solutions. All shiny apps are required to be deployed (either on <http://www.shinyapps.io/> or your own Shiny server).

All developments need to be carried out in group shared private repo on [https://www.github.com/TZstatsADS/] with clear project management log, taking advantage of GitHub issues. 

Each week, we will give a tutorial in class and having live discussion and brainstorm sessions. The instruction team will join team discussions during class and online. 

- week 1: introduction and project description
- week 2: shiny app development/shiny server setup/spatial visualization
- week 3: [TBD] depends on topics emerge from online and in-class discussions.

#### Evaluation criteria 
- Business values of information presented 
	* is it of importance?
	* is it interesting?
	* can it be used to answer questions or exploring for interesting trends?
+ Implementation of the app 
	+ are the data processed/integrated properly?
	+ are necessary measures taken into account for data collection issues such as biases, missing values, etc?
+ Visualization
	+ Is the information visualized clearly?
	+ Is the visualization easy to understand?
+ Presentation and organization
	+ Is the presentation convincing about the business value of the apps?
	+ Is the GitHub organized and prepared in a way that makes it easier for readers to appreciate the value of the app and understand how to use the app?
	
*(More details will be posted as grading rubrics in courseoworks/canvas)*

### Suggested team workflow
1. [wk1] Week 1 is the **studying & planning** week. Read project description, data description, browse data and brainstorm for ideas.
2. [wk1] Each team is strongly recommended to demonstrate project progress by posting a project plan with task assignments, either in piazza or as issues on GitHub before week 2. 
3. [wk1] As a team, study interesting data sets together (not necessarily face-to-face). During the discussion, discuss a number of key analyses/functionalities carefully and discuss possible design ideas.
     * "What information is of value or interesting?"
     * "Which analysis/visualization is particularly informative?" 
     * Good visualizations do not just look cool. They should be easy to understand and give the correct impression about data. 
4. [wk2] Based on outcomes from week 1 brainstorm sessions, identify additional data processing and modeling needed (start early on this one!)
6. [wk2] Week 2 is the **design and development** week. Start learning and using the shiny library to do simple things. Some team members may know more about shiny than others. Share and learn together. 
7. [wk2] It is ok to have 2-3 leads to explore at the beginning of week 2 but it is better to converge on a single direction by the end of week 2.
8. [wk2] Construction of shiny platform can start early using fake/simulated data. 
9. [wk3] Week 3 is the shiny app **implementation/production/testing** week. By the beginning of week 3, you should have all necessary data processing done and a project idea. 
10. [wk3] By the beginning of week 3, You should layout a to-do list (as a 2nd set of GitHub issues) for the app production and divide up tasks. At the class session on week 3, team members should work together and resolve any ambiguity about which team member should be doing what for the final stage of production of the app. 

### Working together
- Setup a GitHub project folder from joining the GitHub classroom link with everyone listed as contributors. Everyone clones the project locally via your GitHub desktop and create a local branch. 
- The team can work in subgroups of 2-3, which might meet more frequently than the entire team. However, everyone should check in regularly on group discussion online and changes in the GitHub folder.
- Learn to work together is an important learning goal of this course.   

### Resources
Here are some examples for inspiration. The order is abitrary. We do not endorse any of these analyses to be a model analysis for you to follow. The tools included are those We think might be useful. Please feel free to send me *stories* and/or *tools* that you would like to contribute to this list.

In my research, my student followed the 3rd example in this blogpost and adapted new json data using [`RJSONIO`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RJSONIO/index.html) using the exsiting d3.js codes in that visualization.
