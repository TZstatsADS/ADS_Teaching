"8","It's good to be home.","They have been magnificent.","I hope we get along.","I hope we get along.","This is your celebration.","I'd do a very good job."
"9","Thanks.","But I don't want to do that.","OK.","Hard to believe.","Hard to believe.","I have many people from Mexico working for me."
"10","All right, everybody sit down.","These are amazing people.","These are amazing people.","He shouldn't be doing it.","He shouldn't be doing it.","We'll do it right."
"11","We're on live TV here.","Don't be rude.","We had Jack Ma.","I didn't tell her.","I don't want that.","I didn't tell her."
"12","I've got to—I've got to move.","It's very interesting how it's going.","I heard he's a nice guy actually.","It's very interesting how it's going.","So there's — maybe it's my office.","Don't be rude."
"13","You can tell that I'm a lame duck because nobody's following instructions.","And immediately the word got out that I had a meeting.","And immediately the word got out that I had a meeting.","This is not believable, but this is what's happening -- refugees on top of existing massive refugee flows coming into our country under President Obama.","And I don't care as long as it's within the United States.","Clinton's plan would trigger a constitutional crisis unlike almost anything we have ever seen before."
"14","Everybody have a seat.","Go ahead.","I could name them, but I won't bother.","Go ahead.","Go ahead.","Yeah, go ahead."
"15","My fellow Americans, Michelle and I have been so touched by all the well wishes that we've received over the past few weeks.","This is for presidents because they don't want presidents getting — I understand, they don't want presidents getting tangled in minutiae.","So if you want to hear the corporate spin, the carefully-crafted lies, and the media myths the Democrats are holding their convention next week.","It was many, many years old.","Go there.","This is for presidents because they don't want presidents getting — I understand, they don't want presidents getting tangled in minutiae."
"16","But tonight, tonight it's my turn to say thanks.","They'd drop them across, right across, and they'd come back.","Now, you know this is where it all began for me.","They'd drop them across, right across, and they'd come back.","This Administration has failed America's inner cities.","I saw the information."
"17","Whether we have seen eye to eye or rarely agreed at all, my conversations with you, the American people, in living rooms and in schools, at farms, on factory floors, at diners and on distant military outposts—those conversations are what have kept me honest and kept me inspired and kept me going.","To all Americans tonight, in all our cities and towns, I make this promise:We Will Make America Strong Again.","When I am President, I will work to ensure that all of our kids are treated equally, and protected equally.","And by the way, Melania and Ivanka -- did they do a job?","I wonder sometimes what he'd say if he were here to see this and to see me tonight.","And to establish new immigration controls to boost wages and to ensure that open jobs are offered to American workers first."
"18","And every day, I have learned from you.","She could pick 'em out from anywhere.","I wonder sometimes what he'd say if he were here to see this and to see me tonight.","Hard to believe with the power we have.","And Hillary Clinton is going to do nothing for the African- American worker, the Latino worker.","And Hillary Clinton is going to do nothing for the African- American worker, the Latino worker."
"19","You made me a better President, and you made me a better man.","They are going to be running it in a very professional manner.","And what I'm going to be doing is my two sons, who are right here, Don and Eric, are going to be running the company.","The establishment protected itself, but not the citizens of our country.","It's waiting to see if we will rise to the occasion, and if we will show the whole world that America is still free and independent and strong.","They are going to be running it in a very professional manner."
"20","So I first came to Chicago when I was in my early twenties.","It belongs to everyone gathered here today and everyone watching all across America.","Day one, my first hour in office, those people are gone.","She's done nothing.","Number one in her class.","Day one, my first hour in office, those people are gone."
"21","And I was still trying to figure out who I was, still searching for a purpose in my life.","What you should do is go down to federal elections and take a look at the numbers.","Number one in her class.","And you can call it deported if you want.","What you should do is go down to federal elections and take a look at the numbers.","Because today we are not merely transferring power from one administration to another or from one party to another, but we are transferring power from Washington, DC, and giving it back to you, the people."
"22","And it was a neighborhood not far from here where I began working with church groups in the shadows of closed steel mills.","These are just and reasonable demands of righteous people and a righteous public.","We're going to get health care taken care of in this country.","It's because of him that I learned, from my youngest age, to respect the dignity of work and the dignity of working people.","Every action I take, I will ask myself: does this make better for young Americans in Baltimore, in Chicago, in Detroit, in Ferguson who have as much of a right to live out their dreams as any other child America?","One by one, the factories shuttered and left our shores, with not even a thought about the millions and millions of American workers that were left behind."
"23","It was on these streets where I witnessed the power of faith and the quiet dignity of working people in the face of struggle and loss.","Obamacare is the Democrats' problem.","Obamacare is the Democrats' problem.","You have deductibles that are so high that after people go broke paying their premiums, which are going through the roof, the health care can't even be used by them because the deductibles are so high.","To my sisters Mary Anne and Elizabeth, my brother Robert and my late brother Fred, I will always give you my love you are most special to me.","You have deductibles that are so high that after people go broke paying their premiums, which are going through the roof, the health care can't even be used by them because the deductibles are so high."
"24","Audience members.","Wait, wait, wait.","Wait, wait, wait.","Are you ready?","Are you ready?","It didn't happen."
"25","Four more years!","November 8.","November 8.","That's what it is.","She's done nothing.","Means so much."
"26","Four more years!","I was in Russia years ago with the Miss Universe contest, which did very well.","Number one in her class.","Day one, my first hour in office, those people are gone.","And just look at the past.","She's been there for 35 years."
"27","Four more years!","That's what it is.","November 8.","November 8.","And just look at the past.","I was in Russia years ago with the Miss Universe contest, which did very well."
"28","The President.","President Eisenhower.","Assimilation, an important word.","So important.","President Eisenhower.","Assimilation, an important word."
"29","I can't do that.","Go ahead.","November 8.","Go ahead.","Thank you.","Go ahead."
"30","Audience members.","Wait, wait, wait.","Wait, wait, wait.","Are you ready?","Are you ready?","It didn't happen."
"31","Four more years!","November 8.","November 8.","That's what it is.","Number one in her class.","And just look at the past."
"32","Four more years!","I was in Russia years ago with the Miss Universe contest, which did very well.","Number one in her class.","Day one, my first hour in office, those people are gone.","And just look at the past.","She's been there for 35 years."
"33","Four more years!","That's what it is.","November 8.","November 8.","And just look at the past.","I was in Russia years ago with the Miss Universe contest, which did very well."
"34","The President.","President Eisenhower.","Assimilation, an important word.","So important.","President Eisenhower.","So important."
"35","Now, this is where I learned that change only happens when ordinary people get involved and they get engaged and they come together to demand it.","Now is the time for all of us as one country, Democrat, Republican, liberal, conservative to band together to deliver justice, and safety, and security for all Americans.","I don't feel like waiting a year or a year and a half.","She didn't know.","She didn't go to Louisiana.","She didn't go to Louisiana."
"36","After 8 years as your President, I still believe that.","They can guide you any way they want to guide you.","Let me tell you who it does not serve.","Let me tell you who it does not serve.","They can guide you any way they want to guide you.","It does not serve you the American people."
"37","And it's not just my belief.","These are amazing women.","These are amazing women.","These are amazing people.","Thank you.","Thank you."
"38","It's the beating heart of our American idea, our bold experiment in self-government.","Our government has no idea.","Iraq was seeing a big, big reduction in violence.","We're like the big bully that keeps getting beat up.","I've been hearing it.","I've been hearing it."
"39","It's the conviction that we are all created equal, endowed by our Creator with certain unalienable rights, among them life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.","An ideological certification to make sure that those we are admitting to our country share our values and love our people.","We can accomplish these great things, and so much else – all we need to do is start believing in ourselves and in our country again.","Oh, we love defeating those people, don't we?","President Obama and Hillary Clinton have engaged in gross dereliction of duty by surrendering the safety of the American people to open borders, and you know it better than anybody right here in Arizona.","Thank you."
"40","It's the insistence that these rights, while self-evident, have never been self-executing;","They can guide you any way they want to guide you.","It's our right, as a sovereign nation to chose immigrants that we think are the likeliest to thrive and flourish and love us.","They can guide you any way they want to guide you.","And this, the United States of America, is your country.","Let me tell you who it does not serve."
"41","that we, the people, through the instrument of our democracy, can form a more perfect Union.","We will seek friendship and good will with the nations of the world, but we do so with the understanding that it is the right of all nations to put their own interests first.","It's our right, as a sovereign nation to chose immigrants that we think are the likeliest to thrive and flourish and love us.","An ideological certification to make sure that those we are admitting to our country share our values and love our people.","Russia will have much greater respect for our country when I'm leading it than when other people have led it.","and while they celebrated in our Nation's Capital, there was little to celebrate for struggling families all across our land."
"42","What a radical idea, a great gift that our Founders gave to us: The freedom to chase our individual dreams through our sweat and toil and imagination, and the imperative to strive together, as well, to achieve a common good, a greater good.","My pledge reads: I'M WITH YOU – THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.","and while they celebrated in our Nation's Capital, there was little to celebrate for struggling families all across our land.","I choose to recite a different pledge.","Together we can save American lives, American jobs, and American futures.","An ideological certification to make sure that those we are admitting to our country share our values and love our people."
"43","For 240 years, our Nation's call to citizenship has given work and purpose to each new generation.","She was invited.","This will require rethinking the failed policies of the past.","their triumphs have not been your triumphs;","Weak and foolish policies.","She was invited."
"44","It's what led patriots to choose republic over tyranny, pioneers to trek west, slaves to brave that makeshift railroad to freedom.","In Libya, our consulate – the symbol of American prestige around the globe – was brought down in flames.","And across.","Let's get unemployed Americans off the welfare and back to work in their own country.","Now let us consider the state of affairs abroad.","We have 2nd generation B-52 bombers – their fathers flew the same plane."
"45","It's what pulled immigrants and refugees across oceans and the Rio Grande.","We're not dropping them right across.","Now let us consider the state of affairs abroad.","And across.","Go ahead.","Yes."
"46","It's what pushed women to reach for the ballot.","From this day forward, a new vision will govern our land.","And immediately the word got out that I had a meeting.","And immediately the word got out that I had a meeting.","And I don't care as long as it's within the United States.","And I thought that was important to put out."
"47","It's what powered workers to organize.","Today, it’s just 182,000.","In 2009, pre-Hillary, ISIS was not even on the map.","Today, the Navy has just 276 ships.","Today, it’s just 182,000.","Syria was under control."
"48","It's why GIs gave their lives at Omaha Beach and Iwo Jima, Iraq and Afghanistan, and why men and women from Selma to Stonewall were prepared to give theirs as well.","Today, it’s just 182,000.","ISIS has spread across the region, and the world.","What have the decisions of Obama-Clinton produced?","In 2009, pre-Hillary, ISIS was not even on the map.","Instead, we must choose to Believe In America."
"49","So that's what we mean when we say America's exceptional: not that our Nation has been flawless from the start, but that we have shown the capacity to change and make life better for those who follow.","Today, it’s just 182,000.","We have 2nd generation B-52 bombers – their fathers flew the same plane.","ISIS has spread across the region, and the world.","The same people.","In 2009, pre-Hillary, ISIS was not even on the map."
"50","Yes, our progress has been uneven.","Any other child.","I am so glad to be back in Arizona.","Our country will thrive and prosper again.","I am so glad to be back in Arizona.","It's time to deliver a victory for the American people."
"51","The work of democracy has always been hard.","Go ahead.","This is your day.","Join me in this mission, we're going to make America great again.","Choose me.","Go ahead."
"52","It's always been contentious.","Zero tolerance for criminal aliens.","Zero tolerance for criminal aliens.","thousands of more violent, horrible crimes;","That's a horrible thing.","thousands of more violent, horrible crimes;"
"53","Sometimes it's been bloody.","Lives ruined.","What the hell are we doing?","We make bad deals.","What the hell are we doing?","We make bad deals."
"54","For every two steps forward, it often feels we take one step back.","History is watching us now.","And now we are looking only to the future.","We, assembled here today, are issuing a new decree to be heard in every city, in every foreign capital, and in every hall of power.","We've met with numerous candidates.","That's what it is."
"55","But the long sweep of America has been defined by forward motion, a constant widening of our founding creed to embrace all and not just some.","So the easiest thing would to be to let it implode in '17 and, believe me, we would get pretty much whatever we wanted but it would take a long time.","We share one heart, one home, and one glorious destiny.","So the easiest thing would to be to let it implode in '17 and, believe me, we would get pretty much whatever we wanted but it would take a long time.","We're in many, many countries and I'm very proud of it.","From this day forward, a new vision will govern our land."
"56","If I had told you 8 years ago that America would reverse a great recession, reboot our auto industry, and unleash the longest stretch of job creation in our history;","That all changes, starting right here and right now, because this moment is your moment: It belongs to you.","This is your day.","Together, we will have one great American future.","It belongs to everyone gathered here today and everyone watching all across America.","Remember that."
"57","if I had told you that we would open up a new chapter with the Cuban people, shut down Iran's nuclear weapons program without firing a shot, take out the mastermind of 9/11;","What you should do is go down to federal elections and take a look at the numbers.","0 Grade Point Average.","You know that story.","It belongs to everyone gathered here today and everyone watching all across America.","Of all my travels in this country, nothing has affected me more deeply than the time I have spent with the mothers and fathers who have lost their children to violence spilling across our border, which we can solve."
"58","if I had told you that we would win marriage equality and secure the right to health insurance for another 20 million of our fellow citizens—if I had told you all that, you might have said our sights were set a little too high.","It's because of him that I learned, from my youngest age, to respect the dignity of work and the dignity of working people.","It is time to show the whole world that America Is Back – bigger, and better and stronger than ever before.","When I am President, I will work to ensure that all of our kids are treated equally, and protected equally.","We can accomplish these great things, and so much else – all we need to do is start believing in ourselves and in our country again.","Together we can save American lives, American jobs, and American futures."
"59","But that's what we did.","I have many people from Mexico working for me.","But I don't want to do that.","Hard to believe.","I think you care.","The same people."
"60","That's what you did.","On the fence.","OK, go ahead.","OK.","OK, go ahead.","He shouldn't be doing it."
"61","You were the change.","Our government has no idea.","I've been hearing it.","I've been hearing it.","Our government has no idea.","Gangs will disappear."
"62","You answered people's hopes, and because of you, by almost every measure, America is a better, stronger place than it was when we started.","Together, we will have one great American future.","This is your day.","From this this day forward, it's going to be only America first.","Together, we will have one great American future.","It's waiting to see if we will rise to the occasion, and if we will show the whole world that America is still free and independent and strong."
"63","In 10 days, the world will witness a hallmark of our democracy.","Let me tell you who it does not serve.","Let me tell you who it does not serve.","It's waiting to see if we will rise to the occasion, and if we will show the whole world that America is still free and independent and strong.","She doesn't have the strength or the stamina to make America great again.","And this, the United States of America, is your country."
"64","Audience members.","Wait, wait, wait.","Are you ready?","Are you ready?","Wait, wait, wait.","It didn't happen."
"65","No!","Go ahead.","Go ahead.","November 8.","Thank you.","Go ahead."
"66","The President.","Assimilation, an important word.","So important.","President Eisenhower.","Very important.","So important."
"67","No, no, no, no, no, the peaceful transfer of power from one freely elected President to the next.","The Bible tells us, How good and pleasant it is when God's people live together in unity.","And especially after meeting with their wonderful, wonderful president today.","In this cause, I am proud to have at my side the next Vice President of the United States: Governor Mike Pence of Indiana.","And especially after meeting with their wonderful, wonderful president today.","I'm asking for your support tonight so that I can be your champion in the White House."
"68","I committed to President-elect Trump that my administration would ensure the smoothest possible transition, just as President Bush did for me.","This is such an important state.","I respected the fact that he said that.","To choose immigrants based on merit.","Vice President Pence also has it.","The Democratic National Committee did not do that."
"69","Because it's up to all of us to make sure our Government can help us meet the many challenges we still face.","To ensure assimilation we want to ensure that it works.","To ensure assimilation we want to ensure that it works.","She's going to do nothing.","But it's — I think they're doing very, very well.","Go ahead."
"70","We have what we need to do so.","The same people.","But I don't want to do that.","Families ripped apart.","We have to solve it.","Hard to believe."
"71","We have everything we need to meet those challenges.","Fast-forward to today.","The meeting was over.","Syria was under control.","Syria was under control.","In 2009, pre-Hillary, ISIS was not even on the map."
"72","After all, we remain the wealthiest, most powerful, and most respected nation on Earth.","We will show the whole world how proud we are to be American.","Unlike my opponent, my foreign policy will emphasize diplomacy, not destruction.","Together we can save America itself.","Libya was stable.","Intelligence agencies are vital and very, very important."
"73","Our youth, our drive, our diversity and openness, our boundless capacity for risk and reinvention means that the future should be ours.","And that includes Supreme Court justices and Second Amendment.","And we're going to put those minds together and were going to form a defense.","We stand at the birth of a new millennium, ready to unlock the mysteries of space, to free the Earth from the miseries of disease, and to harness the energies, industries, and technologies of tomorrow.","And we're going to put those minds together and were going to form a defense.","I could actually run my business and run government at the same time."
"74","But that potential will only be realized if our democracy works.","Join me in this mission, we're going to make America great again.","We will make America wealthy again.","Join me in this mission, we're going to make America great again.","America first!","Go ahead."
"75","Only if our politics better reflects the decency of our people.","When you open your heart to patriotism, there is no room for prejudice.","He was released again after the crime, and now he's out there at large.","He was released again after the crime, and now he's out there at large.","So I want to remind everyone what we're fighting for and who we are fighting for.","In other words, if we had leaders that knew what they were doing, which we don't."
"76","Only if all of us, regardless of party affiliation or particular interests, help restore the sense of common purpose that we so badly need right now.","Weak, weak policies.","Weak, weak policies.","She was invited.","This is an incredible movement.","This is an incredible movement."
"77","That's what I want to focus on tonight: the state of our democracy.","This is an incredible movement.","This is an incredible movement.","This is yet one more area where we are headed in a totally opposite direction.","She was invited.","You came by the tens of millions to become part of a historic movement the likes of which the world has never seen before."
"78","Understand, democracy does not require uniformity.","It's failed them on jobs.","Their victories have not been your victories;","Families ripped apart.","Weak, weak policies.","their triumphs have not been your triumphs;"
"79","Our Founders argued.","After four years of Hillary Clinton, what do we have?","The meeting was over.","Fast-forward to today.","Men, women and children viciously mowed down.","Iran was being choked off by economic sanctions."
"80","They quarreled.","The meeting was over.","Not you.","Not you.","Let's go.","Let's go."
"81","Eventually, they compromised.","Not you.","Not you.",", think of it, into the U.","No, not you.",", think of it, into the U."
"82","They expected us to do the same.","Number one, are you ready?","This is our last time.","This is our last time.","The time for empty talk is over.","Number one, are you ready?"
"83","But they knew that democracy does require a basic sense of solidarity: the idea that for all our outward differences, we're all in this together;","Join me in this mission, we're going to make America great again.","And across.","And whether a child is born in the urban sprawl of Detroit or the windswept plains of Nebraska, they look up at the same night sky, they fill their heart with the same dreams, and they are infused with the breath of life by the same almighty Creator.","Go ahead.","It's waiting to see if we will rise to the occasion, and if we will show the whole world that America is still free and independent and strong."
"84","that we rise or fall as one.","Sadly, sadly there is no other way.","Sadly, sadly there is no other way.","It's going to end very, very badly.","It's going to end badly folks.","Our debt to our men and women in uniform is eternal."
"85","There have been moments throughout our history that threatened that solidarity.","It's waiting to see if we will rise to the occasion, and if we will show the whole world that America is still free and independent and strong.","From this this day forward, it's going to be only America first.","And yet, what do we have to show for it?","America is far less safe – and the world is far less stable – than when Obama made the decision to put Hillary Clinton in charge of America's foreign policy.","The oath of office I take today is an oath of allegiance to all Americans."
"86","The beginning of this century has been one of those times.","This is your day.","But that is the past.","Go ahead.","Together, we will have one great American future.","That's what it is."
"87","A shrinking world, growing inequality;","I've seen people destroyed.","Our drug industry has been disastrous.","I've seen people destroyed.","Our drug industry has been disastrous.","Iraq is in chaos."
"88","demographic change, and the specter of terrorism—these forces haven't just tested our security and our prosperity, but are testing our democracy as well.","We're going to take the problem off the shelves for them.","We're going to take the problem off the shelves for them.","To protect us from terrorism, we need to focus on three things.","Iraq was seeing a big, big reduction in violence.","Obamacare is the Democrats' problem."
"89","And how we meet these challenges to our democracy will determine our ability to educate our kids and create good jobs and protect our homeland.","We only want to admit people to our country who will support our values and love our people.","community under the policies of the White House Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton.","community under the policies of the White House Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton.","In Libya, our consulate – the symbol of American prestige around the globe – was brought down in flames.","We only want to admit people to our country who will support our values and love our people."
"90","In other words, it will determine our future.","Let's stop the drugs and the crime from pouring into our country.","It's failed them on crime.","Let's stop the drugs and the crime from pouring into our country.","He was released again after the crime, and now he's out there at large.","So I want to remind everyone what we're fighting for and who we are fighting for."
"91","To begin with, our democracy won't work without a sense that everyone has economic opportunity.","We have to get our drug industry coming back.","Let's protect our social security and Medicare.","I think you care.","And then she'll say, so long, see you in four years.","We have to get our drug industry coming back."
"92","And the good news is that today the economy is growing again.","We have to build safe zones and we'll get the money from Gulf states.","Americans want great schools for their children, safe neighborhoods for their families, and good jobs for themselves.","Like, we did a good job with Carrier and I want to thank you, United Technologies, which owns Carrier.","Washington flourished, but the people did not share in its wealth.","And especially after meeting with their wonderful, wonderful president today."
"93","Wages, incomes, home values, and retirement accounts are all rising again.","God bless you, everybody.","God bless you, everybody.","God bless you, and God bless America.","God bless you.","God bless you."
"94","Poverty is falling again.","Lives ruined.","We make bad deals.","We make bad deals.","What the hell are we doing?","What the hell are we doing?"
"95","The wealthy are paying a fairer share of taxes even as the stock market shatters records.","And we're going to start bidding and we're going to save billions of dollars over a period of time, and we're going to do that with a lot of other industries.","And we're going to start bidding and we're going to save billions of dollars over a period of time, and we're going to do that with a lot of other industries.","Middle-income Americans and businesses will experience profound relief, and taxes will be greatly simplified for everyone, and I mean everyone.","We are going to lift the restrictions on the production of American energy.","We can also stop funding programs that are not authorized in law."
"96","The unemployment rate is near a 10-year low.","In our nation's capital, killings have risen by 50 percent.","That's the largest increase in 25 years.","We're going to fix that.","Excessive regulation is costing our country as much as $2 trillion a year, and we will end it very very quickly.","I'm very much involved with the generals and admirals on the airplane, the F-35."
"97","The uninsured rate has never, ever been lower.","Doubled since Obama took office, our national debt.","Doubled since Obama took office, our national debt.","First of all, you learn very little from a tax return.","Next comes the reform of our tax laws, regulations and energy rules.","It's going to end very, very badly."
"98","Health care costs are rising at the slowest rate in 50 years.","So, I said let's go and have some fun tonight.","So, I said let's go and have some fun tonight.","We have to get our drug industry coming back.","We have to get our drug industry coming back.","We will bring the same economic success to America that Mike brought to Indiana, which is amazing."

"102","But for all the real progress that we've made, we know it's not enough.","We're in many, many countries and I'm very proud of it.","I really — I'm going to work very hard on that we need certain amounts of other things, including a little bit of luck, but I think we're going to do a real job, and I'm very proud of what we've done, and we haven't even gotten there yet.","I said that I will be the greatest jobs producer that God ever created, and I mean that.","So in order to get the wall started, Mexico will pay for the wall.","So we need people that are smart, we need people that are successful and they got successful because, generally speaking, they're smart."
"103","Our economy doesn't work as well or grow as fast when a few prosper at the expense of a growing middle class and ladders for folks who want to get into the middle class.","Over the weekend, I was offered $2 billion to do a deal in DubaI with a very, very, very amazing man, a great, great developer from the Middle East, Hussein Dumak, a friend of mine, great guy, and was offered $2 billion to do a deal in Dubai, a number of deals.","So in order to get the wall started, Mexico will pay for the wall.","But to this Administration, their amazing daughter was just one more American life that wasn't worth protecting.","I have assets that are — and now people have found out how big the company is — I have very little debt, but I have no loans with Russia at all.","So in order to get the wall started, Mexico will pay for the wall."
"104","That's the economic argument.","It's failed them on crime.","Crime will go down.","The crime will stop.","The crime will stop.","Crime will go down."

"106","While the top 1 percent has amassed a bigger share of wealth and income, too many of our families, in inner cities and in rural counties, have been left behind—the laid off factory worker, the waitress or health care worker who's just barely getting by and struggling to pay the bills—convinced that the game is fixed against them, that their Government only serves the interests of the powerful.","It's because of him that I learned, from my youngest age, to respect the dignity of work and the dignity of working people.","We will rescue kids from failing schools by helping their parents send them to a safe school of their choice.","We're in many, many countries and I'm very proud of it.","To my sisters Mary Anne and Elizabeth, my brother Robert and my late brother Fred, I will always give you my love you are most special to me.","Americans want great schools for their children, safe neighborhoods for their families, and good jobs for themselves."
"107","That's a recipe for more cynicism and polarization in our politics.","And that in particular African- American and Latino workers who are being shut out in this process so unfairly.","He was a guy most comfortable in the company of bricklayers, carpenters, and electricians and I have a lot of that in me also.","And Hillary Clinton is going to do nothing for the African- American worker, the Latino worker.","We're going to get health care taken care of in this country.","We're going to get health care taken care of in this country."
"108","But there are no quick fixes to this long-term trend.","But I will tell you that should never ever happen.","I think a lot of industries are going to be coming back.","We had so many incredible people coming here.","We have to get our drug industry coming back.","And every time I meet people are reading about it."

"112","And so we're going to have to forge a new social compact to guarantee all our kids the education they need, to give workers the power to unionize for better wages, to update the social safety net to reflect the way we live now, and make more reforms to the Tax Code so corporations and individuals who reap the most from this new economy don't avoid their obligations to the country that's made their very success possible.","And that in particular African- American and Latino workers who are being shut out in this process so unfairly.","They supply our drugs, but they don't make them here, to a large extent.","You have deductibles that are so high that after people go broke paying their premiums, which are going through the roof, the health care can't even be used by them because the deductibles are so high.","On top of that she promises uncontrolled, low-skilled immigration that continues to reduce jobs and wages for American workers, and especially for African-American and Hispanic workers within our country.","OK."
"113","We can argue about how to best achieve these goals.","I choose to recite a different pledge.","My pledge reads: I'M WITH YOU – THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.","Well, if I could save jobs.","Together we can save American lives, American jobs, and American futures.","Together we can save America itself."

"119","Race remains a potent and often divisive force in our society.","The attacks on our police, and the terrorism in our cities, threaten our very way of life.","Meanwhile, China has grown more aggressive, and North Korea more dangerous and belligerent.","No challenge can match the heart and fight and spirit of America.","We want to deter, avoid and prevent conflict through our unquestioned military strength.","Zero tolerance for criminal aliens."

"123","And all of us have more work to do.","And those were programs that worked.","OK.","They're leaving left and right.","You've been reading about it.","Fast-forward to today."
"124","If every economic issue is framed as a struggle between a hardworking white middle class and an undeserving minority, then workers of all shades are going to be left fighting for scraps while the wealthy withdraw further into their private enclaves.","Doesn't that sound nice?","And those were programs that worked.","They're leaving left and right.","You've been reading about it.","Thank you."
"125","If we're unwilling to invest in the children of immigrants, just because they don't look like us, we will diminish the prospects of our own children, because those Brown kids will represent a larger and larger share of America's workforce.","And to establish new immigration controls to boost wages and to ensure that open jobs are offered to American workers first.","Thank you.","On top of that she promises uncontrolled, low-skilled immigration that continues to reduce jobs and wages for American workers, and especially for African-American and Hispanic workers within our country.","They're leaving left and right.","They supply our drugs, but they don't make them here, to a large extent."

"128","So if we're going to be serious about race going forward, we need to uphold laws against discrimination: in hiring and in housing and in education and in the criminal justice system.","We also have to be honest about the fact that not everyone who seeks to join our country will be able to successfully assimilate.","We also have to be honest about the fact that not everyone who seeks to join our country will be able to successfully assimilate.","Cases where they go in and they have a minor, early-stage form of cancer and they can't see a doctor.","An attack on law enforcement is an attack on all Americans.","But my greatest compassion will be for our own struggling citizens."

"134","But if our democracy is to work, the way it should, in this increasingly diverse Nation, then each one of us need to try to heed the advice of a great character in American fiction, Atticus Finch, who said, You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view |","We can make new friends, rebuild old alliances, and bring new allies into the fold.","We have 2nd generation B-52 bombers – their fathers flew the same plane.","In 2009, pre-Hillary, ISIS was not even on the map.","Our Army has been shrinking rapidly, from 553,000 soldiers in 2009 to just 479,000 today.","We can make new friends, rebuild old alliances, and bring new allies into the fold."

"136","For Blacks and other minority groups, that means tying our own very real struggles for justice to the challenges that a lot of people in this country face, not only the refugee or the immigrant or the rural poor or the transgender American, but also the middle-aged White guy who, from the outside, may seem like he's got advantages, but has seen his world upended by economic and cultural and technological change.","This has been an incredible evening.","Now, all of these papers that you see here — yes, go ahead.","I am going to bring our jobs back to Ohio and Pennsylvania and New York and Michigan and all of America – and I am not going to let companies move to other countries, firing their employees along the way, without consequences.","We have other companies.","I saw the information."
"137","We have to pay attention and listen.","I respect the people of Mexico.","I think it's pretty sad.","You'll be proud of our country again.","I think it's pretty sad.","People are so happy."
"138","For White Americans, it means acknowledging that the effects of slavery and Jim Crow didn't suddenly vanish in the sixties, that when minority groups voice discontent, they're not just engaging in reverse racism or practicing political correctness.","America is far less safe – and the world is far less stable – than when Obama made the decision to put Hillary Clinton in charge of America's foreign policy.","I am certain it is a decision President Obama truly regrets.","America is a nation of believers, dreamers, and strivers that is being led by a group of censors, critics, and cynics.","They want a president to run the country.","They want a president to run the country."
"139","When they wage peaceful protest, they're not demanding special treatment, but the equal treatment that our Founders promised.","I’m going to ask all the Angel Moms to come join me on the stage right now.","So, I said let's go and have some fun tonight.","We'll build safe zones which is something that I think all of us want to see.","And they're great people and great leaders but they're going to pay for the wall.","So, I said let's go and have some fun tonight."
"140","For native-born Americans, it means reminding ourselves that the stereotypes about immigrants today were said, almost word for word, about the Irish and Italians and Poles, who it was said were going to destroy the fundamental character of America.","We, assembled here today, are issuing a new decree to be heard in every city, in every foreign capital, and in every hall of power.","And now we are looking only to the future.","And, yes, together, we will make America great again.","It's waiting to see if we will rise to the occasion, and if we will show the whole world that America is still free and independent and strong.","They'd drop them across, right across, and they'd come back."
"141","And as it turned out, America wasn't weakened by the presence of these newcomers;","Yeah, go ahead.","I saw the information.","They'd drop them across, right across, and they'd come back.","OK, go ahead.","They were never in the same room together as a group."
"142","these newcomers embraced this Nation's creed, and this Nation was strengthened.","It does not serve you the American people.","It does not serve you the American people.","Let me tell you who it does not serve.","Let me tell you who it does not serve.","She doesn't have the strength or the stamina to make America great again."
"143","So regardless of the station that we occupy, we all have to try harder.","I have many people from Mexico working for me.","We could sit back and let them hang with it.","I am your voice!","They get mocked by these people.","We're going to take care of our workers."
"144","We all have to start with the premise that each of our fellow citizens loves this country just as much as we do;","It is time to show the whole world that America Is Back – bigger, and better and stronger than ever before.","I think you care.","I wonder sometimes what he'd say if he were here to see this and to see me tonight.","You know that story.","I am your voice!"
"145","that they value hard work and family just like we do;","And Hillary Clinton is going to do nothing for the African- American worker, the Latino worker.","I think you care.","You know that story.","She's going to do nothing.","It is a two-way street, right?"
"146","that their children are just as curious and hopeful and worthy of love as our own.","Americans want great schools for their children, safe neighborhoods for their families, and good jobs for themselves.","Washington flourished, but the people did not share in its wealth.","We're in many, many countries and I'm very proud of it.","Like, we did a good job with Carrier and I want to thank you, United Technologies, which owns Carrier.","Well, if I could save jobs."
"147","And that's not easy to do.","This has been an incredible evening.","She's going to do nothing.","We have other companies.","So there's a great spirit going on right now, a spirit that many people have told me they've never seen before, ever.","We're going to Arizona, OK?"
"148","For too many of us, it's become safer to retreat into our own bubbles, whether in our neighborhoods or on college campuses or places of worship or especially our social media feeds, surrounded by people who look like us and share the same political outlook and never challenge our assumptions.","But I think it's just something we're going to have to live with.","America is a nation of believers, dreamers, and strivers that is being led by a group of censors, critics, and cynics.","They can't do anything about these people, and they want to.","So we need people that are smart, we need people that are successful and they got successful because, generally speaking, they're smart.","The guy looked at her like, what is she doing?"
"149","And the rise of naked partisanship and increasing economic and regional stratification, the splintering of our media into a channel for every taste—all this makes this great sorting seem natural, even inevitable.","Thank you.","These are amazing people.","We are going to put in Mr.","And that's what I put.","Thank you."
"150","And increasingly, we become so secure in our bubbles that we start accepting only information, whether it's true or not, that fits our opinions, instead of basing our opinions on the evidence that is out there.","Syria was under control.","But that’s not all.","But that’s not all.","Syria was under control.","And what happened is I had my meeting."

"153","That's how our democracy was designed.","But here, at our convention, there will be no lies.","We have to do that for our country.","Thank you.","Thank you.","These are amazing people."
"154","In the course of a healthy debate, we prioritize different goals, and the different means of reaching them.","These are amazing people.","They live with these people.","Hard to believe.","Most incredibly, because to me this is unbelievable, we have no idea who these people are, where they come from.","Thank you."
"155","But without some common baseline of facts, without a willingness to admit new information and concede that your opponent might be making a fair point, and that science and reason matter, then we're going to keep talking past each other, and we'll make common ground and compromise impossible.","They can guide you any way they want to guide you.","They live with these people.","Thank you.","Does anyone really believe that story?","They can guide you any way they want to guide you."
"156","And isn't that part of what so often makes politics dispiriting?","The politicians have talked about it, I'm going to do it.","Probably less likely that it's a payment.","Let's stop the drugs and the crime from pouring into our country.","Let's stop the drugs and the crime from pouring into our country.","Very complicated stuff."
"157","How can elected officials rage about deficits when we propose to spend money on preschool for kids, but not when we're cutting taxes for corporations?","It's failed them on crime.","Government-wide, improper government payments are estimated to exceed $135 billion per year, and the amount of unpaid taxes is estimated to be as high as $385 billion.","Government-wide, improper government payments are estimated to exceed $135 billion per year, and the amount of unpaid taxes is estimated to be as high as $385 billion.","While Hillary Clinton plans a massive -- and I mean massive -- tax increase, I have proposed the largest tax reduction of any candidate who has declared for the presidential race this year – Democrat or Republican.","We can also reduce the size of the federal bureaucracy through responsible workforce attrition – that is, when employees retire, they can be replaced by a smaller number of new employees."
"158","How do we excuse ethical lapses in our own party, but pounce when the other party does the same thing?","I've gone through them.","I appreciate that from Ford.","Very complicated stuff.","And they're going to be moving into Michigan and expanding very substantially an existing plant.","This is yet one more area where we are headed in a totally opposite direction."
"159","It's not just dishonest, this selective sorting of the facts;","It's very unfair to our country what's happened.","It's very unfair to the country.","It's a disgrace what took place.","So they're very, very dishonest people.","It's very unfair to the country."
"160","it's self-defeating.","But I don't want to do that.","You've been waiting.","You are fake news.","This has been an incredible evening.","Hard to believe."
"161","Because, as my mom used to tell me, reality has a way of catching up with you.","Together, we will make America strong again.","And, yes, together, we will make America great again.","Remember: it has failed America's inner cities.","Go ahead.","This is your day."
"162","Take the challenge of climate change.","No challenge can match the heart and fight and spirit of America.","I've been hearing it.","I've been hearing it.","Meanwhile, China has grown more aggressive, and North Korea more dangerous and belligerent.","I've been hearing it."
"163","In just 8 years, we've halved our dependence on foreign oil, we've doubled our renewable energy, we've led the world to an agreement that has the promise to save this planet.","America is far less safe – and the world is far less stable – than when Obama made the decision to put Hillary Clinton in charge of America's foreign policy.","We'll build safe zones which is something that I think all of us want to see.","Russia will have much greater respect for our country when I'm leading it than when other people have led it.","In Libya, our consulate – the symbol of American prestige around the globe – was brought down in flames.","It's our right, as a sovereign nation to chose immigrants that we think are the likeliest to thrive and flourish and love us."

"166","Now, we can and should argue about the best approach to solve the problem.","Iraq was seeing a big, big reduction in violence.","Right now, however, we're in the middle of a jobs crisis, a border crisis and a terrorism crisis like never before.","Americans watching this address tonight have seen the recent images of violence in our streets and the chaos in our communities.","The forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer.","Right now, however, we're in the middle of a jobs crisis, a border crisis and a terrorism crisis like never before."
"167","But to simply deny the problem not only betrays future generations, it betrays the essential spirit of this country, the essential spirit of innovation and practical problem-solving that guided our Founders.","America first!","We will not fail.","Hopefully, none.","History is watching us now.","Remember that."
"168","It is that spirit, born of the Enlightenment, that made us an economic powerhouse: the spirit that took flight at Kitty Hawk and Cape Canaveral, the spirit that cures disease and put a computer in every pocket.","We will not fail.","History is watching us now.","Hopefully, none.","We will be fair, just, and compassionate to all, but our greatest compassion must be for our American citizens.","America first!"
"169","It's that spirit, a faith in reason and enterprise and the primacy of right over might, that allowed us to resist the lure of fascism and tyranny during the Great Depression;","And we're admitting them to our country.","Hopefully, none.","I call it extreme vetting right?","It's always 11 million.","Remember that."
"170","that allowed us to build a post-World War II order with other democracies, an order based not just on military power or national affiliations, but built on principles: the rule of law, human rights, freedom of religion and speech and assembly, and an independent press.","In 2009, our Marine Corps had 202,000 active Marines.","Our Convention occurs at a moment of crisis for our nation.","I have a message to every last person threatening the peace on our streets and the safety of our police: when I take the oath of office next year, I will restore law and order to our country.","To choose immigrants based on merit.","In 2009, our Marine Corps had 202,000 active Marines."
"171","That order is now being challenged, first by violent fanatics who claim to speak for Islam, more recently by autocrats in foreign capitals who see free markets and open democracies and civil society itself as a threat to their power.","Today, it’s just 182,000.","Syria was under control.","What have the decisions of Obama-Clinton produced?","In 2009, pre-Hillary, ISIS was not even on the map.","Syria was under control."
